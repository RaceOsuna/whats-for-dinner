### Context: 
The project overall was finished about 5 days after receiving it and I am 3 weeks into the Turong program. I believe it could have been completed sooner with more features if personal issues hadn't been a factor.

### Learning Goals: 
Gain experience building an application that utilizes HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Write HTML and CSS to match a provided comp.
Understand how to listen to and respond to user events.
Individualize your programming skill set.

### Wins + Challenges:
The biggest challenge was creating the radio buttons and making only one of them selectable at a time. It turns out they all just needed a common name.
The page also needs to be refreshed to give a differnt random suggestion which I wasn't able to find a fix for. I think I might need a "load" event. ???
At one point I attempted to make a clear all button, but after creating an event listener for the button all of my suggestions would come back as undefined. So, I'm a bit confused about what I did wrong there.
CSS and HTML are still tricky but it is starting to make sense.
The biggest win is that I am continuing to grow and learn more every day! I thought resetting the radio buttons after each section was nice small touch, and making an alert was cool as well!
